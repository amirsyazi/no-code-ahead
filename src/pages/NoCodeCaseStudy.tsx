            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Trap of Traditional Development</h2>
            <p>
              You spend years building an app. Tens of thousands of dollars. Sleepless nights. 
              Endless emails with developers who speak in a language you don't fully understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, launch day comes. And your users hate it. It's slow. Clunky. A nightmare to update. 
              Every small tweak requires weeks of back-and-forth. Customers complain. Your competitors move faster. 
              And you‚Äîdespite investing everything‚Äîfeel like you're sinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's exactly where my client found themselves. They had poured <strong>two years and $60,000</strong> into 
              their app. It was live, it was functional‚Äîbut it wasn't scalable. Every small UI/UX change required an 
              exhausting development cycle. They had a team of traditional developers, but the complexity of their tech 
              stack meant that even the smallest fix required navigating a maze of dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>
              They were stuck. Do they spend <strong>another year and thousands more</strong> to rebuild their app from scratch? 
              Or do they risk launching a product that, at its core, wasn't designed for the speed of the modern market?

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The No-Code Pivot</h2>
            <p>
              That's when they found me. I introduced them to No-Code‚Äînot as a quick hack, but as a <strong>real solution</strong> 
              to their scaling problems. With <strong>Bubble.io</strong>, I helped them rebuild their app <strong>in just 5 months</strong> 
              instead of another <strong>1-2 years</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Not only did we slash development time, but we also cut costs dramatically:</p>

              </li>
              <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                <span className="text-green-500">‚úÖ</span>
                <span><strong>Performance optimized</strong>‚Äîwe restructured their app for <strong>speed & efficiency</strong></span>

              <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                <span className="text-green-500">‚úÖ</span>
                <span><strong>Instant UI/UX updates</strong>‚Äîinstead of waiting weeks, they could implement changes in real-time</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The best part? They weren't stuck anymore.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">From Weeks to Hours</h2>
            <p>
              Before No-Code, <strong>even a minor design tweak took weeks</strong>. A simple button placement change? 
              A new onboarding flow? They'd have to file a request with their dev team, wait for an available sprint, 
              and pray that nothing broke in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now? During our <strong>weekly meetings</strong>, I could <strong>implement UI/UX changes in real-time</strong>‚Äîsometimes 
              in under <strong>2-3 hours</strong>, right in front of them.
            </p>
            <p className="italic">
              "This used to take us months. Now it's done before our next meeting."
            </p>
            <p>
              That shift‚Äîfrom reactive to <strong>adaptive</strong> development‚Äîcompletely changed their approach to product building.

              <li className="flex items-start gap-2">
                <span className="text-green-500">‚úîÔ∏è</span>
                <span><strong>Their team finally felt in control</strong>‚Äîinstead of being held hostage by a slow dev cycle</span>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">No-Code Isn't Just for MVPs</h2>
            <p>
              The biggest myth about No-Code? That it's only good for prototypes. This client <strong>proved otherwise</strong>. 
              They had a <strong>fully-coded app</strong>‚Äîand we <strong>rebuilt it in No-Code, faster and cheaper</strong>, 
              without sacrificing <strong>performance, scalability, or user experience</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              No-Code is no longer just an "MVP tool." It's a <strong>serious alternative</strong> to traditional 
              development‚Äîespecially for founders who need to move fast.
